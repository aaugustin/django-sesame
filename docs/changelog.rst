.. admonition:: Version 2.0 introduces a faster and shorter token format (v2).
    :class: important

    The new format (v2) is enabled by default for new tokens.

    The original format (v1) is still supported for backwards-compatibility.

    See :ref:`Tokens design` for details.

.. admonition:: Changed the default name of the URL parameter to ``sesame``.
    :class: warning

    If you need to preserve existing URLs, you can set the

.. admonition:: Changed the argument expected by
        :func:`~django.contrib.auth.authenticate` to ``sesame``.

    explicitly. If so, change this call to ``authenticate(sesame=...)``.
