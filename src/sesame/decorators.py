    Decorator that looks for a signed token in the URL and authenticates a user.

    If a valid token is found, the user is available as ``request.user`` in the
    view. Else, :exc:`~django.core.exceptions.PermissionDenied` is raised,
    resulting in an HTTP 403 Forbidden error.

    :obj:`authenticate` may be applied to a view directly::

        @authenticate
        def view(request):
            ...

    or with arguments::

        @authenticate(scope="status-page")
        def view(request):
            ...

    If ``scope`` is set, a :ref:`scoped token <Scoped tokens>` is expected.

    If ``max_age`` is set, override the :data:`SESAME_MAX_AGE` setting.

    Set ``required`` to :obj:`False` to set ``request.user`` to an
    :class:`~django.contrib.auth.models.AnonymousUser` and execute the view when
    the token is invalid, instead of raising an exception. Then, you can check
    if ``request.user.is_authenticated``.

    :obj:`authenticate` doesn't log the user in permanently. It is intended to
    provide direct access to a specific resource without exposing all other
    private resources. This makes it more acceptable to use the less secure
    authentication mechanism provided by django-sesame.

    Set ``permanent`` to :obj:`True` to call :func:`~django.contrib.auth.login`
    after a user is authenticated.

    :obj:`authenticate` doesn't care if a user is already logged in. It looks
    for a signed token anyway and overrides ``request.user``.

    Set ``override`` to :obj:`False` to skip authentication if a user is already
    logged in.
