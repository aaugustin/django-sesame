`django-sesame`_ provides frictionless authentication with "Magic Links" for
your Django project.

.. _django-sesame: https://github.com/aaugustin/django-sesame

It generates URLs containing an authentication token such as:
https://example.com/?url_auth_token=AAAAARchl18CIQUlImmbV9q7PZk%3A89AEU34b0JLSrkT8Ty2RPISio5

Then it authenticates users based on tokens found in URLs.

Use cases
=========

Known use cases for django-sesame include:

1. Login by email, an increasingly attractive option on mobile where
   typing passwords is uncomfortable. This technique is prominently
   deployed by Slack.

   If you're doing this, you should define a small ``SESAME_MAX_AGE``, perhaps
   10 minutes, and consider enabling ``SESAME_ONE_TIME``.

2. Authenticated links, typically if you're generating an export or a report
   and emailing a link to access it. An authenticated link will work even if
   the user isn't logged in on the device where they're opening it.

   Likewise, you should configure an appropriate ``SESAME_MAX_AGE``, probably
   no more than a few days.

3. Non-critical private websites, for example for a family or club site,
   where users don't expect to manage a personal account with a password.
   Authorized users can bookmark personalized authenticated URLs.

   Here you can rely on the default settings because that's the original use
   case for which django-sesame was built.

(In)security
============

**Before using django-sesame in your project, please review the following
advice carefully.** (Also, please don't use security-sensitive libraries
published by strangers on the Internet without checking what they do.)

The major security weakness in django-sesame is a direct consequence of the
feature it implements: **whoever obtains an authentication token will be able
to authenticate to your website.**

URLs end up in countless insecure places: emails, referer headers, proxy logs,
browser history, etc. You can't avoid that. At best you can mitigate it by
creating short-lived or single-use tokens, as described below.

Otherwise, a reasonable attempt has been made to provide a secure solution.
django-sesame uses Django's signing framework to create signed tokens. It
offers configurable options for token expiration or invalidation.

Requirements
============

django-sesame is tested with:

- Django 1.11 (LTS), 2.1, 2.2 (LTS) and 3.0;
- all supported Python versions.

It builds upon ``django.contrib.auth``.

It supports custom user models, provided:

- They have an integer or UUID primary key — other types could be added
  if there's a use case;
- They have ``password`` and ``last_login`` fields — most custom user models
  inherit them from ``AbstractBaseUser``.

django-sesame is released under the BSD license, like Django itself.

Getting started
===============

1. Install django-sesame and ua-parser::

    $ pip install django-sesame
    $ pip install ua-parser  # optional, see "Safari issues" below

2. Add ``sesame.backends.ModelBackend`` to ``AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS``::

    AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS += ['sesame.backends.ModelBackend']

3. Add ``sesame.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware`` to ``MIDDLEWARE``::

    MIDDLEWARE += ['sesame.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware']

   The best position for ``sesame.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware`` is
   just after ``django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware``.

4. Generate authentication tokens with ``sesame.utils.get_query_string(user)``.

That's all!

Generating URLs
===============

django-sesame provides two functions to generate authenticated URLs.

1. ``sesame.utils.get_query_string(user)`` returns a complete query string
   that you can append to any URL to enable one-click login.

2. ``sesame.utils.get_parameters(user)`` returns a dictionary of GET
   parameters to add to the query string, if you're already building one.

Share resulting URLs with your users while ensuring adequate confidentiality.

By default, the URL parameter is called ``url_auth_token``. You can set the
``SESAME_TOKEN_NAME`` setting to a shorter name that doesn't conflict with
query string parameters used by your application.

Tokens lifecycle
================

By default, tokens don't expire but are tied to the password of the user.
Changing the password invalidates the token. When the authentication backend
uses salted passwords — that's been the default in Django for a long time —
the token is invalidated even if the new password is identical to the old one.

If you want tokens to expire after a given amount of time, set the
``SESAME_MAX_AGE`` setting to a duration in seconds. Then each token will
contain the time it was generated at and django-sesame will check if it's
still valid at each login attempt.

If you want tokens to be usable only once, set the ``SESAME_ONE_TIME`` setting
to ``True``. In that case tokens are only valid if the last login date hasn't
changed since they were generated. Since logging in changes the last login
date, such tokens are usable at most once.

If you don't want tokens to be invalidated by password changes, set the
``SESAME_INVALIDATE_ON_PASSWORD_CHANGE`` setting to ``False``. **This is
strongly discouraged because it becomes impossible to invalidate tokens**
short of changing the ``SECRET_KEY`` setting. If you're doing it anyway, you
should set ``SESAME_MAX_AGE`` to a short value to minimize risks. This option
may be useful for generating tokens during a signup process, when you don't
know if the token will be used before or after initializing the password.

Finally, if the ``is_active`` attribute of a user is set to ``False``,
django-sesame rejects authentication tokens for this user.

Per-view authentication
=======================

The configuration described in the "Getting started" section enables a
middleware that looks for a token in every request and, if there is a valid
token, logs the user in. It's as if they had submitted their username and
password in a login form.

Sometimes this behavior is too blunt. For example, you may want to build a
Magic Link that gives access to a specific view but doesn't log the user in
permanently.

To achieve this, you can remove ``sesame.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware``
from the ``MIDDLEWARE`` setting and authenticate the user with django-sesame
in a view as follows::

    from django.core.exceptions import PermissionDenied
    from django.http import HttpResponse

    from sesame.utils import get_user

    def hello(request):
        user = get_user(request)
        if user is None:
            raise PermissionDenied
        return HttpResponse("Hello {}!".format(user))

When ``SESAME_ONE_TIME`` is enabled, ``get_user()`` updates the user's last
login date in order to invalidate the token. When ``SESAME_ONE_TIME`` isn't
enabled, it doesn't, because making a database write for every call to
``get_user()`` could degrade performance. You can override this behavior with
the ``update_last_login`` keyword argument::

    get_user(request, update_last_login=True)   # update last_login
    get_user(request, update_last_login=False)  # don't update last_login

``get_user()`` is a thin wrapper around the low-level ``authenticate()``
function from ``django.contrib.auth``. If you use ``authenticate()`` to verify
an authentication token, the ``sesame.backends.ModelBackend`` authentication
backend expects an ``url_auth_token`` argument::

    from django.contrib.auth import authenticate

    user = authenticate(url_auth_token=...)

If you rely on ``authenticate()``, you must update ``user.last_login`` to
ensure one-time tokens are invalidated. Indeed, in ``django.contrib.auth``,
``authenticate()`` is a low-level function and the higher-level ``login()``
function is responsible for updating ``user.last_login``.

Safari issues
=============

django-sesame removes the token from the URL with a HTTP 302 Redirect after
authenticating a user successfully. Unfortunately, in some scenarios, this
triggers Safari's "Protection Against First Party Bounce Trackers". In that
case, Safari clears cookies and the user is logged out.

To avoid this problem, django-sesame doesn't perform the redirect when it
detects that the browser is Safari. This relies on the ua-parser package,
which is an optional dependency. If it isn't installed, django-sesame always
redirects.

Stateless authentication
========================

Technically, django-sesame can provide stateless authenticated navigation
without ``django.contrib.sessions``, provided all internal links include the
authentication token, but that increases the security issues explained above.

If ``django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware`` and
``django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware`` aren't enabled,
``sesame.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware`` sets ``request.user`` to the
currently logged-in user or ``AnonymousUser()``.
